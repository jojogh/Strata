# ExtendedEnum Roll Convention configuration

# Additional files may be added to the classpath with the same name
# All files will be loaded and built into a chain
# The resulting configuration is a combination of the files in the chain
#
# The various files in the chain are combined using a simple algorithm defined in the '[chain]' section.
# Firstly, the 'priority' value is used to sort the files, higher numbers have higher priority
# All entries in the highest priority file are used
# Note that priorities 0 to 99 inclusive are reserved by OpenGamma
#
# Once data from the highest priority file is included, the 'chainNextFile' property is examined
# If 'chainNextFile' is 'true', then the next file in the chain is considered
# The 'chainRemoveSections' property can be used to ignore specific sections from the files lower in the chain
#
# The chain process continues until the 'chainNextFile' is 'false', or all files have been combined

# The section name includes the group name of the externals
# The key is the alternate name
# The value is the standard name (loaded by a provider)
